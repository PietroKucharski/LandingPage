            <h2>Top 3 JavaScript Frameworks for Server-side Rendering in 2022</h2>

            <p>How fast the browser renders your app depends on how you build it. The first thing the browser receives is an HTML document. This document contains references to other assets — such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>The browser knows to go fetch and download these assets when it parses this HTML document. So, even though the browser has your HTML, it cant actually render the website until its corresponding CSS has finished parsing.
            </p>

            <p>Once thats done, the browser goes ahead and renders the page. That means that with just HTML and CSS, the browser can render the page. As we know the browser is good at this, so it does it very fast.
